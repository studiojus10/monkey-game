# Infinite Monkeys

An idle game about infinite monkeys typing at random until they write Shakespeare. It runs in your terminal and is written in TypeScript. The full design and build plan are in [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md).

## Playing

Requires Node 22.12 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `a` or `i` | Pick your first letter (start of the game only) |
| `space` | Poke the monkey into typing an extra letter |
| `s` | Save now |
| `r` | Reset progress (asks to confirm) |
| `q` or `Ctrl+C` | Save and quit |

## What's in it

- **A monkey** at a typewriter, typing 2 random letters a second from the letters you own.
- **Your first letter**: A or I, since it has to be a word on its own. Every word the monkey types scores points; for now each one-letter word is worth 1.
- **Autosave** to `save.json` every 10 seconds and on quit. Set `IDLE_SAVE=path/to/file.json` to use a different file, which is handy for testing from a fresh start.
- **Offline progress**: the monkey keeps typing while you're away, up to 8 hours.

## Development

```bash
npm test           # run unit tests
npm run typecheck  # type-check without running
```

Names and balance numbers are all in [`src/game/config.ts`](src/game/config.ts); the terminal screen picks changes up automatically.
